Originally called DB-BEAD, this software was written
in C++ using Borland C++Builder 5 and the VCL library.

This version is a port to Java 6 using the Swing GUI
library.

The whole project is licensed under the GPL v3 or later.

For creating a launcher/setup program for windows
platforms, two additional open-source projects
are used: launch4j for createing a launcher exe,
NSIS for creating a setup program.

But the application can be simply installed by
copying the jbead.jar and launching it from
the command line or from a batch file using
'java -jar jbead.jar', provided that a Java
Runtime Environment 1.6.0 or later is installed.
